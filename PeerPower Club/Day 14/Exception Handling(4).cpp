// If an exception is thrown and not caught anywhere, the program terminates abnormally. 
// For example, in the following program, a char is thrown, but there is no catch block to catch a char.  

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	try {
	throw 'a';
	}
	catch (int x) {
		cout << "Caught ";
	}
	return 0;
}

// We can change this abnormal termination behavior by writing our own unexpected function.
